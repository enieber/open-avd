# open-avd

this project is based in [this question, Open AVD or emulators without opening Android Studio](https://superuser.com/questions/1186289/open-avd-or-emulators-without-opening-android-studio) that has [this gist to work in linux](https://gist.github.com/hidroh/67b2ee7bbdd9038450c00d8a4d69c3fa) and my modification to work in windows 7.
